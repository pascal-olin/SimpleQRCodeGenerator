Easily generate URL or WIFI QRCodes  
PO 31/10/2019
This is simply a way to generate QR codes easily for either 
1) an URL (or actually any text you want) 
2) A wifi connection (WPA/WPA2) 

for Wifi, the button Get and store Known networks will give you a drop down list of the WPA/WPA2 networks that are already present 
on your machine, 
you can then decide to click on the list, and to create a QR code (that includes SSID and password). 
the QR code can then be saved by cliking on it's image and then be incorporated in a document or simply printed as is via any BMP/JPG aware editor (eg. MSPaint)
