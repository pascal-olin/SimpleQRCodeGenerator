# SimpleQRCodeGenerator
Easily generate URL or WIFI (wireless network) QRCodes  
PO 31/10/2019
This is simply a way to generate QR codes easily for either 
1) an URL (or actually any text you want) 
2) A wifi connection (WPA/WPA2) so that you can print or email it for other to use it with any clever QR Code reader on their device. 

for Wifi, the button Get and store Known networks will give you a drop down list of the WPA/WPA2 networks that are already present 
on your machine (it may take a while if you have a lot of SSIDs stored). 
you can then decide to click on the list, and to create a QR code (that includes SSID and password). 
you can also decide to store the list in your settings (in your profile) or not, if you do, next time you launch SimpleQRCodeGenerator, the list will be populated without delay


The QR code (wifi or text) can then be saved by cliking on it's image and then be incorporated in a document or simply printed as is via any BMP/JPG aware editor (eg. MSPaint)

for phones and tablets, they are either already part of the default camera (Iphones) and there are plenty of them in the android play repo https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobile.qrcodereader&hl=fr
